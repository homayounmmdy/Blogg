This repository documents my learnings from **Design Systems with Storybook, v2** on Frontend Masters, taught by **Steve Kinney** (Engineering Director at Temporal and creator of multiple popular frontend courses).

## About the Course

A hands-on guide to building scalable, maintainable **design systems** using **Storybook** as a development and documentation environment. The course emphasizes **component-driven development**, **composable styling with Tailwind CSS**, and **robust testing strategies** all essential for modern frontend teams.

Key topics include:

* 🧱 **Component architecture**: Building reusable, well-typed UI components with clear APIs  
* 🎨 **Styling with Tailwind**: Custom themes, dark mode, and consistent design tokens  
* 🧪 **Interaction testing**: Using Play Functions and Storybook Test Runner to simulate user flows  
* 📚 **Documentation with MDX**: Writing rich, living docs alongside components  
* 🌓 **Theming & variants**: Managing color palettes, sizes, and states with type safety (via `clsx` and **Class Variance Authority**)  
* 👁️ **Visual & accessibility testing**: Integrating Chromatic and `addon-a11y` for quality assurance  
* ⚙️ **Advanced workflows**: Loaders for async data, decorators for context providers, and query param controls  

The course blends theory with practical exercises like building a `Button` and `Callout` component from scratch while teaching how to structure a production-ready design system.

## 🚀 Why I Took This Course

I took this course to **sharpen my component architecture skills** and deeply understand how **Storybook can transform the way teams organize, document, and test UI codebases**.

My goals were to:

* Move beyond isolated component demos to **cohesive, scalable design systems**
* Learn how to use **Storybook as a single source of truth** for UI components
* Implement **type-safe variant patterns** (e.g., size, theme, state) with tools like **Class Variance Authority**
* Integrate **automated testing and visual regression** into the component workflow
* Improve **developer experience** through interactive documentation and playgrounds

This course significantly improved my ability to:

* Structure component libraries with consistency and intentionality  
* Document design decisions directly in code using MDX  
* Catch visual and accessibility regressions early  
* Build components that are flexible, composable, and easy to maintain  

## 💡 Extra Project: Retro-blog + Storybook

As a practical application, I built retro-blog a sleek, developer-friendly blog template infused with **retro-futurist aesthetics**: glowing terminals, CRT scanlines, circuit grids, and cyberpunk vibes.  

Built with **Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**, it includes fully typed, ready-to-use components. I then integrated **Storybook** to:

* Document each component’s API and variants  
* Test responsive behavior and dark/light modes  
* Validate accessibility and visual consistency  
* Create a sandbox for future theme extensions  

This project solidified my understanding of how Storybook bridges design, development, and QA in real-world applications.

## 📢 Access Note

Due to regional restrictions in Iran, I accessed this course through alternative means. While I don’t have an official certificate, I completed all coding exercises and have documented my implementations and key takeaways in this repository.
